# Mailserver
A simple mailserver I created with Express for my portfolios contact form. Attach it to your contact form on your site and when someone does a POST request you get an email (nodemailer) with the content of the POST request. A Sqlite database is built to store all the data. Might be a problem to upload on Heroku with the sqlite database, but works on railway.app.


# Package list

   body-parser
   cors
   express
   nodemailer
   sqlite3


# NPM install to get all the packages.
